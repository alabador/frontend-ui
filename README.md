# Frontend-UI Challenges 

This repository contains UI challenges meant to keep frontend skills sharp. Many of these designs come from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home), but will occasionally include my own UI designs, created in Figma.

## How It's Made 

**Common Tech Used:** 
+ HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
+ additional frameworks for practice/learning (SCSS preprocessor, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, React). 

## Lessons Learned

Varies by project, more details in each individual project README.
